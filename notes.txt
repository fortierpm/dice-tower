How to set up

* Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications/
* Click create application and give bot name
* Choose bot image/icon
* Go to Bot tab
* Add bot to application
* Go to OAuth2 URL Generator and choose "bot" scope and whatever bot permissions you'd like
* Copy URL generated below
	* Note this URL and tab is never saved and must be redone each time you'd like to share the bot to another server
* Got to URL in browser
	* Select the server you'd like to add the bot to
	* Check permissions
	* Complete until "you may close this tab" and it says bot is authorized
	* Bot should show up/join the discord server

* Go to repl.it and log in
* New repl
* Choose Node.js as format/language
* Name repl whatever such as [bot name], doesn't matter
* Create repl
Note: repl automatically downloads/install (npm ...) dependencies from run file, but repl's version of Node.js is not modern enough for discord.js, so resuse old package.json and package-lock.json files here from older version of discord.js


* For constant activation/continuously active bot note server.js file in this repl and the corresponding module import/require in index.js
* Run index.js to pull up browser window within repl workspace and copy link in top right
* Go to https://uptimerobot.com and log in
* On UptimeRobot add new Monitor
	* Monitor type: HTTP(s)
	* Friendly Name: [Bot name] but shouldn't matter
	* URL or IP: paste URL
	* Monitor interval: 5 min
	* Monitor timeout: can be left on default (30 sec)
	Optional: opt in to alert notications to email about monitor (if something happens or goes wrong)
